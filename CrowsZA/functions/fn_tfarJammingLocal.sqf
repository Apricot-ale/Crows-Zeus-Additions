//when placing, give option to select: side to jam, radius from object, jamming strength (distance from center where no radio can be used), jamming function, (Linear, or exponential etc), satcom override?

//add option to only jam particular side, although not sure how that handles radios you pick up from enemies. Edge case perhabs. FUTURE, requires base jam to work with multiple jammers before adding side selection to each jammer
